# Change Log

## V1.1.0 <small> Mar 2022 </small>
### Features
1. dai
    1. model evaluation: support model evaluation and live evaluation through random split, cross validation or LOO
    2. self-computing: support two computing modes for executors, one is to compute using others' data, one is to compute using their own data
### Improvements
1. crypto
    1. improve security of pairing-based PoRH: upgrade algorithm to avoid mod-N attack, which enables storage nodes to pass challenges using only slice data mod N

## V1.0.0 <small> Jan 2022 </small>
This is the first public release of PaddleDTX.
